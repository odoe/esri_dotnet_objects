h1. C# Objects for use with "ESRI Flex API":http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/flex/index.html.

I thought there might be some interest in these, since I couldn't find any samples when I needed them.
These are the basic ESRI Flex objects you would use in an ESRI Flex application that you can use in a Remote Object service of your choice.

For example, in the ESRI Flex API, the class FeatureSet has a RemoteAlias defined.
[RemoteClass(alias="com.esri.ags.FeatureSet")]
public class FeatureSet{...}

Then in your RemoteObject Service, we have a C# counterpart class called com.esri.ags.FeatureSet.
This means, you can create an instance of this class in your service and return the raw FeatureSet and your Flex application will atomatically serialize the Remote FeatureSet to the ESRI Flex counterpart. Pretty cool right?

This is a sample of how I would convert an ArcObjects Polygon to the equivalent ESRI Flex counterpart.
bc. ESRI.ArcGIS.Geometry.Polygon poly = (Polygon)m_geom; // Some previous polygon geometry retrieved using ArcObjects
com.esri.ags.geometry.Polygon pg = new com.esri.ags.geometry.Polygon();
pg.rings = new com.esri.ags.geometry.MapPoint[1][];
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
{
	ESRI.ArcGIS.Geometry.IPoint pt = poly.get_Point(i);
	mp[i] = new com.esri.ags.geometry.MapPoint(pt.X, pt.Y, m_sr);
}
pg.rings[0] = mp;

So far, these are working for my current needs. Please feel free to use and update as needed.
